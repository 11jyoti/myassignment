    "Components of a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Network\n",
    "A Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network is a type of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) designed to address the limitations of traditional RNNs, particularly the vanishing gradient problem. LSTMs are especially effective in handling long-term dependencies in sequential data.\n",
    "\n",
    "LSTM networks are composed of specialized components that allow them to retain information over long periods and control the flow of information more effectively than standard RNNs\n",

    "How LSTM Addresses the Vanishing Gradient Problem\n",
    "The vanishing gradient problem occurs in standard RNNs when gradients (used during backpropagation) become very small as they are propagated backward through many layers or time steps. This results in the network losing the ability to learn long-term dependencies because gradients essentially vanish.\n",

    "\n",
    "Gates Control Information Flow:\n",
    "The gates in an LSTM (forget, input, and output gates) explicitly control how much of the information is kept, forgotten, and updated at each time step. This gives LSTM cells the ability to maintain and pass on relevant information over long sequences without gradients shrinking.\n",
